### Lyrical Meaning 💭

"By your side" is a deeply introspective ballad that explores the vulnerability of unrequited or uncertain love. The narrator, feeling inadequate and unworthy, struggles with self-doubt while simultaneously unable to resist the pull of affection toward someone they consider far beyond their reach. The song captures that delicate moment when love strikes for the first time—a bewildering mix of disbelief, hope, and desperate determination not to let go.

Throughout the song, Riria's lyrics weave a narrative of emotional honesty. The references to Cinderella's story symbolize the narrator's yearning for an impossible dream to become reality. Despite knowing that their relationship might be as fleeting as a bubble-like dream, they choose to embrace it fully, refusing to close their eyes as they did before meeting this person. The repeated plea "Can I stay here by your side?" becomes both a question and an affirmation of commitment, while the final resolution—"I will do my best to suit being next to you"—shows acceptance of effort and dedication required to maintain this precious connection.

The beauty of the song lies in its portrayal of how love transforms us. The narrator emphasizes repeatedly that this person is special because they're the first to make them feel this way, to make them want to plan ahead, to lean on someone, and to refuse regret. It's a touching meditation on vulnerability, hope, and the willingness to take emotional risks for the sake of love.
