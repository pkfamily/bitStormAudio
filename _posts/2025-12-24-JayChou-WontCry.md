## 📖 Lyrics

### Verse 1 🎵

沒有了聯絡  
**Méi yǒu le lián luò**  
We haven’t been in touch.  

後來的生活 我都是聽別人說  
**Hòu lái de shēng huó wǒ dōu shì tīng bié ren shuō**  
I’ve heard from others how you’ve been.  

說妳怎麼了 說妳怎麼過  
**Shuō nǐ zěn me le shuō nǐ zěn me guò**  
They talked about how you’ve been and what you’ve been up to.  

放不下的人是我  
**Fàng bu xià de rén shì wǒ**  
I’m the one who can’t let go.

### Verse 2 🎵

人多的時候 就待在角落  
**Rén duō de shí hou jiù dài zài jiǎo luò**  
When there’s a lot of people, I stay in the corner.  

就怕別人問起我  
**Jiù pà bié ren wèn qǐ wǒ**  
I’m afraid others will ask me  

你們怎麼了  
**Nǐ men zěn me le**  
“What happened between you two?”  

妳低著頭  
**Nǐ dī zhe tóu**  
You lower your head.  

護著我 連抱怨都沒有  
**Hù zhe wǒ lián bào yuàn dōu méi yǒu**  
You protect me and don’t even complain.

### Verse 3 🎵

電話開始躲  
**Diàn huà kāi shǐ duǒ**  
You started avoiding my calls.  

從不對我說  
**Cóng bù duì wǒ shuō**  
You would never tell me  

不習慣一個人生活  
**Bù xí guàn yī gè rén shēng huó**  
How you weren’t used to living alone.  

離開我以後 要我好好過  
**Lí kāi wǒ yǐ hòu yào wǒ hǎo hǎo guò**  
After leaving me, you wanted me to live well.  

怕打擾想自由的我  
**Pà dǎ rǎo xiǎng zì yóu de wǒ**  
You were afraid to trouble me, who wanted freedom.

**Dōu zhè ge shí hou nǐ hái zài yì zhe**  
Even at this time, you’re still caring about  

別人是怎麼怎麼看我的

How others see me.  

拼命解釋著 不是我的錯

眼看著妳難過  
**Yǎn kàn zhe nǐ nán guò**  
I watched as you were sad,  

挽留的話卻沒有說  
**Wǎn liú de huà què méi yǒu shuō**  
Yet I didn’t say anything to urge you to stay.  

妳會微笑放手

You would smile and let go.  

說好不哭讓我走

You had said not to cry as you let me go.

### Bridge / Outro 🌉

你什麼都沒有  
**Nǐ shén me dōu méi yǒu**  
You had nothing,  

卻還為我的夢加油  
**Què hái wéi wǒ de mèng jiā yóu**  
Yet you still supported my dreams.  

心疼過了多久  
**Xīn téng guò le duō jiǔ (guò le duō jiǔ*)**  
After your heart has ached for such a long time,  

還在找理由等我  
**Hái zài zhǎo lǐ yóu děng wǒ**  
You’re still looking for a reason to wait for me.
